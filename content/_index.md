This a Cybersecurity and SysAdmin blog 👽️

I usually upload different sort of things to ease our life when we have a task in front of us:

* [Cheatsheets](tags/cheatsheet/) about penetration testing and programming 💲
* [System Administration](tags/sysadmin): how to set up different services and apps 📄
* [Linux Course](tags/linux) 🐧
* [DIY Projects](tags/projects) such as a Rubber Ducky or a Rogue AP 🔨
* [Writeups](writeups) for [HTB](writeups/htb) or [THM](writeups/thm) machines 👹

You can stay tuned for upcoming posts with the [RSS feed](index.xml)!
